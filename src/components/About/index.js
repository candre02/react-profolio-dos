                Hi, I'm Crystal Andre and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. I'm a problem solver by nature, who loves learning the why behind all things technical. 
                In my past career, I spent over a decade working as a mechanic: first on cars, then doing more complex electrical work on forklifts and diesel trucks. 
                I love learning new ways to improve processes and become more efficient, and I'm passionate about delivering the best possible outcomes for my team and end client. 
            </p>
